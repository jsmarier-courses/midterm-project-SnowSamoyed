## Template for the Midterm Project: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Here are the my files for the midterm project of courses MPAD2003 Introductory Data Storytelling offered at Carleton University.

It includes a Exploratory Data Analysis written inside of markdown under the file `mpad2003_midterm_MaxineZeng.md`. Where I have cleaned and analyzed data from `ottawa-311-service-requests-august-2024.csv`

A few simple visualizations were created to assist my analysis. This assignment is a good practise for utilizing data in the future.

The cleaned and analyzed dataset is being presented with a link to Google sheets in the analysis page.
